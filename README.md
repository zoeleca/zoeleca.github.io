# portfolio-v1

### Hi there ! 
Welcome to My Portfolio ! Here is a minimalist but responsive website to present myself..
I mainly used HTML & CSS to make it, but I am currently working on a second version using React, Tailwind and Figma ;)

Thanks to all the feedbacks. <br>
I've changed the skills sections removing the progress bar and instead putting the logo of the stacks I use. <br>
I've modified the project section as well by adding a description to each project. <br>
I've added a CV download button and a contact form!

<br>

Check it out <a href='https://zoeleca.github.io/'>Here</a>!
