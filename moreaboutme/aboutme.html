                <h2><em>I'm happy that you want to learn more about me !</em></h2>
                <p>I'm Zoe but my friends call me zozo!
                    <br>I was born and grew up in a small but unique archipelago called
                    <a href="https://www.newcaledonia.travel/en"><strong>New Caledonia</strong></a>.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    New Caledonia (or "Le Caillou" in french) is a beautiful place. <br> We have mountains, Beaches,
                    Rivers all with different landscapes<br>
                    In New Caledonia, we love doing outdoors activities. <br> We can ride horses, kayak, surf, ride a
                    bike and many more!
                    <br>I love surfing, hiking and riding bikes !! <br>
                    <br>An other amazing thing is that we have lots of Sea Turtles and Whales that comes near by or
                    shore ! I was even lucky enough to see one !<br>
                    <br> Since New Caledonia is a group of island, it is pretty much isolated from the world, but that
                    makes it even more precious. <br>
                    Nature and a clean Environnement is for us very important

                <p>I arrive to "Europe France" in 2018. It was my first time being so far away from my Family.<br>
                    I moved to a city called Nantes to study "Graphic Design".
                    The study itself was really interesting but the way it was taught was quite disapointing.
                    This same year, I got to learn about French protestation which were quite violent.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Knowing that I couldn't learn more that I already did I decided to change my Major to Korean.<br>
                    It was a language that I liked and found easy to learn due to the logic of the grammar.<br>
                    During those three years at University, I learn about transport Strike and lockdown due to the
                    pandemic. <br>
                    Although it was not easy, I learn a lot about me and I slowly became more independent ^^.

                <br>
                <h2><em>I really love coffee & Tea !</em></h2>
                <p>I've always wanted to do Latte Art.
                    I've always found it fascinating to mix the aesthetic of the latte art with the flavour of the
                    different type of coffee.<br>
                    <br>Nowadays, I am working in a coffee shop called Binici.
                    It has now been a few years, It started as a part-time job to help me with the city life cost, but
                    it soon became fun to make coffee and other beverage.<br>
                    There I'm able to try different coffee beans, to work with a professional steaming and coffee making
                    machine <br><br>
                    Practicing latte art making different figures is always fun!
